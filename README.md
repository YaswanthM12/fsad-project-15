## Backend Setup (Implemented)

The project now includes a Node.js + Express backend in the `backend/` directory with JWT auth and role-based APIs.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set optional frontend API URL in `.env`:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

> If backend is not running, the app automatically falls back to offline demo mode for login/register and core loan workflows.

## Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials on login/register page

3. User data stored in localStorage
4. AuthContext provides user info to entire app
5. Protected routes check authentication status
6. Unauthorized access redirects to login

## State Management

### AuthContext
- Manages user authentication state
- Provides login/logout/register functions
- Persists user data in localStorage

### LoanContext
- Manages loan data
- Provides CRUD operations for loans
- Handles application approval/rejection
- Manages payment recording

## Styling

Custom CSS with design system:
- **Color Scheme**: Blue (#2563eb) primary, slate secondary
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Components**: Cards, buttons, forms, badges, modals
- **Spacing**: 8px base unit for consistency

## Performance Optimizations

- React Router for client-side navigation
- Context API for efficient state management
- CSS-in-JS optimization
- Lazy loading ready (can be enhanced)
- Chart.js for efficient data visualization

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use
```bash
# Kill process on port 5173
# Windows: taskkill /F /IM node.exe
# Mac/Linux: lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
```

### Dependencies not installing
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Hot reload not working
